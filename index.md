I am a PhD student in the Data Semantics Lab (<a href="http://dase.cs.wright.edu/" target="_blank">DaSe Lab</a>), affiliated to the Computer Science department of Wright State University (<a href="http://www.wright.edu/" target="_blank">WSU</a>), OH, USA. My advisor is <a href="http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/" target="_blank">Dr. Pascal Hitzler</a>. I also work closely with <a href="http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/PM/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Prabhaker Mateti</a>. 

I completed my Masters in Computer Science from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.mnnit.ac.in/" target="_blank">MNNIT</a>), Allahabad, India and my Bachelors in Computer Science from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (<a href="http://www.jntuh.ac.in/" target="_blank">JNTU</a>), Hyderabad, India.  

I am interested in Semantic Web and building large scale systems. The work done during my PhD revolves around these interests. My thesis work in particular, explores scalable approaches for ontology reasoning.
