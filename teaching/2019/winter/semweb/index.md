Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is a field of AI that deals with capturing knowledge of the world in a form suitable for machines to act on. This helps machines in taking decisions based on the domain knowledge and rules. In this course, we will be looking at KRR from a Semantic Web perspective. Semantic Web technologies are now widely used by several commercial enterprises (Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, IBM, GE) in the form of Knowledge Graphs (semantic descriptions of entities and their relationships) and ontologies. They play a key role in knowledge driven applications across several domains such as life science, geoscience, healthcare, IoT, smart cities etc.
